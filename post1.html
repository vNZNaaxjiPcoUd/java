Yesterday once more(昨日重現)

When I was young I'd listen to the radio
當我年輕的時候，我會聽收音機
Waitin' for my favorite songs
等待我最喜歡的歌
When they played I'd sing along
播出來的時候我會跟著唱
It made me smile
那讓我微笑
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
那些時光真是快樂不久以前
How I wondered where they'd gone
我多麼想知道他們到哪去了
But they're back again just like a long lost friend
但他們又回來了，就像一個失去很久的朋友
All the songs I loved so well
那些我所鐘愛的歌曲
Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-oh-wo-oh still shines
每句莎拉拉拉，每一個喔喔喔喔，依然閃亮
Every shing-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
每句開頭是星兒玲兒玲的，都是這麼美好
When they get to the part where he's breakin' her heart
當唱到他害她心碎的部份時
It can really make me cry just like before
真的會讓我哭，就像以前一樣
It's yesterday once more
彷彿昨日重現
shooby-doo-lang-lang, shooby-doo-lang-lang
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
回顧消逝的歲月裡的種種
And the good times that I had
以及我曾有過的美好時光
Makes today seem rather sad
讓當下變得令人悲傷
So much has changed
很多事已經改變了
It was songs of love that I would sing to them
我會唱給他們聽的就是情歌
And I'd memorize ezch word
而且我會記得每一個字
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
那些古老的旋律我聽來仍然美好
As they melt the years away
當它們把歲月融化時
Every sha-la-la-la, every wo-oh-wo-oh still shines
每句莎拉拉拉，每一個喔喔喔喔，依然閃亮
Every shing-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine
每句開頭是星兒玲兒玲的，都是這麼美好
All my best memoriescome back clearly to me
我所有美好的回憶都清楚地回來了
Some can even make me cry. Just like before
有一些甚至會讓我哭，就像以前一樣
It's yesterday once more.
彷彿昨日重現
Every Sha-la-la-la every Wo-o-wo-o Still shines
每句莎拉拉拉，每一個喔喔喔喔，依然閃亮
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're startin' to sing's So fine.
每句開頭是星兒玲兒玲的，都是這麼美好
Every Sha-la-la-la every Wo-o-wo-o Still shines
每句莎拉拉拉，每一個喔喔喔喔，依然閃亮
